## 🌐 Who I Am

I’m building toward mastery in **backend systems, security-minded software, and distributed systems** — one real project at a time.  
Long game only.

**Core lanes:**  
Python | Linux | Go | C | Cryptography | Distributed Systems

This GitHub is my **Personal Engineering Archive**.  
Not throwaways — but tools, systems, experiments, and lessons that *hopefully* compound over time…  
*“supposedly”* 😂

## 💡 What I Build

- **Automation & Systems Tools**  
  Scripts, CLIs, and utilities that reduce friction and enforce correctness.

- **Backend Infrastructure**  
  APIs, services, and data flows built with reliability and clarity in mind.

- **Security & Blockchain Experiments**  
  Learning by breaking shit!😂 

Each repo is a snapshot in time:  
*what I was solving, how I thought about it, and what I learned.*

## 📦 How to Read This GitHub

- Repos = **receipts**, not demos  
- READMEs explain **why**, not just how  
- Progress > polish (until it’s time to polish) 

If you’re a recruiter or engineer:  
this is what I’m *actually* working on.
