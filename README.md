## 🌐 Who I Am
I’m an entry-level developer with a bold vision:  
to level up into an elite engineer by 2026—building systems that power startups, secure critical infrastructure, and spark creative tech innovation.  

I code with a mix of precision and flair—clean engineering discipline fused with a **trippy edge** that makes projects not only work hard but look and feel next-level.

## 💡 What I Build
- **iOS Apps** – Sleek, smooth, and user-focused  
- **Automation Tools** – Scripts that save hours, if not days  
- **Backend Systems** – Scalable, reliable, and future-ready  

Every line of code I write is meant to perform, scale, and inspire.
